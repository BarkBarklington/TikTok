## Legal basis to cite
- **Unprofessional conduct** and examples are enforced by the BON; the BON lists behaviors that may expose a patient to unnecessary risk and accepts complaints about such conduct[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.bon.texas.gov/discipline_and_complaints_policies_and_guidelines_filecomplaint.asp?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054&citationId=1 "Texas Board of Nursing").  
- For rule language on **unprofessional conduct**, cite **22 Tex. Admin. Code §217.12**[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/texas/22-Tex-Admin-Code-SS-217-12?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054&citationId=2 "LII / Legal Information Institute")
